Cross Section Of The Menger Sponge With OpenSCAD
------------------------------------------------
A while back I found [this puzzle](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/10/can-you-solve-it-the-incredible-sponge-puzzle) on what the cross section of a Menger Sponge would look like.
This repository contains a simple [OpenSCAD](openscad.org/) script that answers the question.
This is also my first OpenSCAD experience!

Unfortunately, due to my lack of OpenSCAD experience and not enough time, this script contains a brute-force solution rather than an elegant recursive (I'll put that on "todo" list :D).
